## General Information
Background: Melanoma is a deadly type of skin cancer accounting for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prognosis.
Business Problem: Manual diagnosis of melanoma requires significant effort and expertise. Automating this process can greatly assist dermatologists in identifying potential cases of melanoma more quickly and accurately.
Dataset: The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). It covers a range of diseases including Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Nevus, Pigmented benign keratosis, Seborrheic keratosis, Squamous cell carcinoma, and Vascular lesion.

## Conclusions
Conclusion 1:   The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the validation set.
Conclusion 2: Melanoma and Nevus images were the most challenging to differentiate for the model.
Conclusion 3:  Augmenting the dataset improved the model's performance by 8%.
